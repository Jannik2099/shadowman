compiler shadow directory manager
( 2-BSD licensed eselect module )


shadowman is a management tool for compiler shadow directories that
are used by ccache, distcc, icecc and similar tools.

Why? Because right now, Gentoo bundles its own *-config tool for every
program out there. Each of these tools has different usage and different
limitations.

The idea behind shadowman is to provide a single tool that supports all
the compiler wrappers out there, and that can easily be extended to
support more. This has a number of advantages:

1. one usage syntax that works for all tools,

2. ability to update/clean masquerades for multiple tools in one call,

3. consistent (and *good*) implementation -- now all tools get the same
executable list,

4. reduced code duplication.

shadowman can not only replace the existing *-config tools but also
extend their usefulness. For example, toolchain packages can be extended
to call 'eselect compiler-shadow update all' in postinst and save
the user from manually updating shadow directories post compiler
upgrades.
